## Project description
This project was made as part of the Front-End module.  
The goal was to create a simple, responsive website using **HTML**, **CSS**, and a small amount of **JavaScript**.  
The idea of the page is to present a clean layout with a hero section, navigation, and responsive cards that adjust to different screen sizes.

I learned how to:
- Build and style pages with HTML and CSS
- Use Flexbox and CSS Grid for layouts
- Create simple interactivity using JavaScript
- Manage version control with Git and GitHub
- Publish a live website using GitHub Pages

## Technologies used
- HTML5  
- CSS3 (Flexbox, Grid, Media Queries)  
- JavaScript (basic interactivity)  
- Git & GitHub  

## How to run
1. Open the repository in Visual Studio Code or any code editor.  
2. Open the file **index.html** in your browser to see the website locally.  
3. The site is also available online at:

## Learning diary
The full learning diary for this module can be found in the file **LearningDiary.md** inside this repository.

## Reflection
Through this project I learned how front-end technologies work together to create a responsive web page.  
I also learned how to publish a live site and gained more confidence with GitHub and version control.
